# PART 2: USER EXPERIENCE WORKFLOWS

## 1. Entry Points (3 Options)

### Option A: Build from Prompt (Greenfield)
```
User Action: Types natural language prompt
Example: "Build a CRM for real estate agents"
System Response:
  1. Validates prompt
  2. Calls /api/plan-build
  3. AI generates 12-15 tickets
  4. Displays plan in Kanban
  5. Awaits user approval to build
```

### Option B: Clone from URL
```
User Action: Enters website URL to clone
Example: "stripe.com"
System Response:
  1. Scrapes website (screenshot + content)
  2. Analyzes structure and design
  3. Calls /api/plan-build with context
  4. AI generates tickets based on scraped site
  5. Displays plan in Kanban
```

### Option C: Import from GitHub (Brownfield)
```
User Action: Connects GitHub, selects repository
System Response:
  1. OAuth flow → GitHub connection
  2. Fetches repository structure
  3. Parses existing codebase
  4. AI generates tickets to extend/modify
  5. Displays plan in Kanban
```

---

## 2. Planning Phase

### Auto-Planning Flow
```
Input: User prompt or scraped content
Process:
  1. AI analyzes request
  2. Breaks down into discrete tickets
  3. Estimates complexity (XS, S, M, L, XL)
  4. Identifies dependencies
  5. Detects required user inputs (API keys, etc.)
Output: BuildPlan with 12-15 KanbanTickets
```

### Plan Refinement
```
User Actions Available:
  - Edit ticket title/description
  - Add new tickets
  - Remove tickets (with dependency warnings)
  - Reorder tickets (drag-drop)
  - Provide required inputs

UI Elements:
  - Inline editing
  - "Add Step" button
  - Dependency visualization
  - "Move to Pipeline" button (commits plan)
```

---

## 3. Execution Phase (Kanban Command Center)

### View Modes
| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Kanban Board | Source of truth - ticket management |
| App Preview | Live sandbox showing built application |
| Split View | Side-by-side (optional) |

### Build Modes

#### Auto-Build Mode
```
Trigger: User clicks "Auto-Build"
Behavior:
  - Tickets move automatically: Backlog → Generating → Applying → Testing → Done
  - Real-time progress updates
  - Pause button available at any time
  - Resume continues from last ticket
```

#### Manual Build Mode
```
Trigger: User enables "Manual Build" toggle
Behavior:
  - "Build This" button on each ticket
  - User authorizes each ticket individually
  - Skip/defer ticket options
```

### Human-in-the-Loop (Stuck State)
```
Trigger: Ticket requires user input (API key, credential, clarification)
Behavior:
  - Ticket moves to "Awaiting Input" column
  - Visual highlighting (pulsing border)
  - User clicks ticket → Input modal appears
  - User provides input
  - Ticket resumes to "Backlog"
```

---

## 4. Board Logic & Guardrails

### Column Progression
```
Valid Flow:
  Backlog → Generating → Applying → Testing → Done

Invalid Actions:
  - Cannot skip columns (ToDo → Done blocked)
  - Cannot move to non-adjacent column directly
```

### Backward Regression (Undo)
```
Trigger: User drags ticket from Done/Review back to Backlog
Behavior:
  1. Warning modal: "Moving this back will remove the associated feature code. Proceed?"
  2. If confirmed:
     - Soft-delete/comment out associated code
     - Trigger auto-refactor for stability
     - Reset ticket status
  3. If cancelled: No action
```

---

## 5. GitHub Integration

### Import Flow
```
1. User clicks "Import from GitHub"
2. OAuth authentication
3. Repository selector modal
4. Branch selection
5. Code analysis
6. Plan generation
```

### Export Flow
```
1. User clicks "Export to GitHub"
2. Options:
   a. Create new repository (name, public/private)
   b. Push to existing repository (branch selector)
3. Commit message input
4. Push execution
5. Success → Link to repository
```

### Auto-Commit (Optional)
```
Toggle: "Auto-commit after each ticket"
Behavior: After ticket completion → Auto-push to selected repo
```
